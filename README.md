Covid 19 Vaccinations project in Python.

4 questions: What are the top 5 biggest countries with vaccinations progress? What are the top 5 smallest countries with vaccinations progress? What vaccine is most common and least used? What is the global average vaccinations by month?

3 datasets were used: 2021 world population, country vaccinations, country vaccination by manufacturer.

2 hypothesis ( Pearson Correlation Test):1.between the overall population and fully vaccinated people,2. between partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated people

Compared data of different vaccination programs by country and manufacture. 
Checked for a death rate correlation to the different programs.
The hypothesis studied the possibility of a correlation between the extent of the vaccine program as well as the
type of vaccine used.
